  I've had other pages before, but I want this to be different.
</p>

<p>
  I already have spaces for news / for food / for music / for art / for culture / for creative writing.
  <br>
  But never have I had a space for dedicated learning;
  <br>
  for reflection, and gentle rumination.
</p>

<p>
  Since finishing graduate school, there has been a distinct shift in my life. The day after I walked that stage, responsibility and all that it meant morphed right in front of my eyes. I've had to learn for myself how to better prioritize my work, play, family and friends, because - for the first time in my entire life - I didn't have a school system to guide or support me. Just me. I'm glad that I can say it's all different now. Balanced. Better.
</p>

<p>
  I've been put in a place where my learning is wholly dependent on my own drive. There aren't mandatory lectures or looming thesis deadlines. It's just me and the rest of the world. At first, it was daunting. I felt directionless
  <br>

  <br>
  crushed under the weight of the world and all of its infinite possibilities. Like I couldn't grow into my skin fast enough. It's taken time, and I've done my best to take it all in stride. As the years have passed, I've loosened up and realized that everyone is just trying to find their rhythm and keep pace, which has made me a lot more comfortable in my own growth. I've gotten better about goal-setting, and working to achieve those goals incrementally, but the one bit that always eluded me was self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
  This is an attempt to undo that.
</p>

<p>
  I want this blog, these posts, these words to be a verbal exploration of my personal growth; not just a blog full of half-hearted tips or tutorials, or my life edited down to the successes -- but the struggle, the grit, and the grind. The unsure thoughts and questions that mark any journey where the destination is a moving target.
</p>

<p>
  I want these posts to be honest. So this is where I start.
  <br>
  Onward & Upward!
  <br><br>
  A.
